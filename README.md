# MARL-UDS
Source code, data and figures for the MARL-enabled real-time control of urban drainage systems.

## UDS Environments
1. **Astlingen**: A benchmark model of a combined sewer system with 6 storage tanks and 4 controllable outflow orifices. The SWMM model [Astlingen](https://github.com/open-toolbox/SWMM-Astlingen) is the case area. Thanks to Dr. Sun and other contributers for developing this model.

2. **chaohu**: A real-case model of a combined sewer system with 3 pump stations and forebays. Papers using this model:
